# Categorical Time Series Analysis

**CategoricalTimeSeries.jl** is a Julia package regrouping methods of categorical time-series analysis. The term *categorical* commonly refers to two types of data: *nominal* and *ordinal*.
*Nominal*, or labeled values represent *discrete* units that have no intrinsic *order*, like common types of pet:
* Cat
* Dog
* Bird
* Fish
*Ordinal* values on the other hand represent *discrete* and *ordered* units, like the size of a coffee cup:
* 1 - Small
* 2 - Medium
* 3 - Large
